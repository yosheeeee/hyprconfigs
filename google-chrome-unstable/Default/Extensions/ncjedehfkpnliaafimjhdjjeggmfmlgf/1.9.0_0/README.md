# Bing Chat sidebar for Chrome

[**Install from Chrome Web Store**](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/bing-sidebar-for-chrome/ncjedehfkpnliaafimjhdjjeggmfmlgf)

AI-powered Bing sidebar ported from Microsoft Edge to Chrome, with the same features like accessing the current webpage or PDF.

## How it works

You can learn how I reverse engineered the Edge sidebar in this [Twitter thread](https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1676175646970740736.html)

## Supported browsers

This extension uses the [chrome.sidePanel](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/reference/sidePanel/) API, which is only available since Chrome 114. Therefore it only works with Google Chrome, version 114 or higher, and may not be compatible with other Chromium-based browsers, such as Brave, Arc, Opera, etc.

## Privacy

This extension does not collect any user data. Requests are sent directly from your browser to Bing's server using HTTPS. There is no middle server and no one else can see the requests, responses and their content.
